  [Hint: 'cudaErrorLaunchFailure'. An exception occurred on the device while executing a kernel. Common causes include dereferencing an invalid device pointerand accessing out of bounds shared memory. Less common cases can be system specific - more information about these cases canbe found in the system specific user guide. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work willreturn the same error.
